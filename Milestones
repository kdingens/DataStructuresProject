Milestones to hit:
3 pts - Java research and familiarity
10 pts - Create classes and polymorphic functions in Java
7 pts - Scrape data from websites using JSON to populate the data structures
15 pts - Build the foundations of our Android App
5 pts - Incorporate Google Maps into the app

*** this is just a sample milestones idea, If you have more to add or would like to change the points value please go ahead and do so. 
I figured it would be helpful to have this in our repository.
